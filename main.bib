@article{Ahmed2021,
abstract = {With the increasing prevalence of Internet usage, Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatment (IDPT) has become a valuable tool to develop improved treatments of mental disorders. The task becomes complicated and laborious because of the overlapping emotion in mental health. This paper focuses on the application of personalized mental health intervention using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and attention-based in-depth entropy active learning. The objective of the research is to increase the trainable instance using a semantic clustering mechanism. For this purpose, we propose the method based on synonym expansion by semantic vectors. Semantic vectors based on semantic information derived from the context in which it appears are clustered. The resulting similarity metrics help to select the subset of unlabeled text by using semantic information. The proposed method separates the unlabeled text and includes it in the next active learning mechanism cycle. The method updates the model training by using the new training points. The cycle continues until it reaches the optimal solution, and it converts all the unlabeled text into the training set. Experimental results show that the synonym expansion semantic vectors help enhance training accuracy while not harming the results. The bidirectional LSTM architecture with an attention mechanism achieved the 0.85 ROC on the blind test set. The learned embedding is then used to visualize the activated word's contribution to each symptom and find the psychiatrist's qualitative agreement. The method improves the detection rate of depression symptoms from online forum text using the unlabeled forum texts.},

abstract="This paper presents an exploratory study of how conversational interfaces can be used to facilitate peer support among adults with ADHD participating in an online self-help program. Peer support is an important feature of group therapy, but it is often disregarded in online programs. Using a research-through-design approach, a low fidelity chatbot prototype named Terabot was designed and evaluated. The goal of Terabot is to guide participants through peer support conversations related to a specific exercise in an online self-help program. The prototype was evaluated and refined through two Wizard of Oz (WoOz) trials. Based on design workshops, analysis of chat logs, data from online questionnaires and an evaluation interview, the findings indicate that the concept of a chatbot guiding a peer support conversation between adults with ADHD who participate in an online self-help program is a promising approach. We believe that a chatbot can help establishing structure, predictability and encouragement in a peer support conversation. This study contributes with experiences from an exploration of how to design conversational interfaces for peer support in mental health care, how conversational interfaces can facilitate peer support through structuring conversation, and how the WoOz approach can be used to inform the design of chatbots.",
